# DeviantTidy

[Install the Greasemonkey Script from Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/5681-devianttidy)

## Introduction

DeviantTidy is a set of styles and scripts to improve the layout and usability of DeviantArt.

Ever since DAv5, many users have been unhappy with various aspects of DeviantArt's layout and design.  Some decisions on font size, margins and spacing have clearly been neglected.

And so DeviantTidy was written, to claim back much of that wasted space!  Inspired by some of Jan Van Lysebettens's CSS mods for Firefox, DeviantTidy was a very lightweight modification to fix comment boxes and various other assets on dA pages, to make things clearer and more streamlined.  Since then, it's expanded to cover lots of other annoyances, big and small, to improve the look and usability of the site. With a JavaScript interface, it's fully customizable too.

## Features

- **More efficient comment boxes**: DeviantTidy reduces the minimum height and margins on comment boxes, and further reduces the size of signatures, so you can see more comments at once. You can also add scrollbars to really long comments.
- **Hide and collapse elements**: Hide social sharing buttons, 'More Like This' mini-galleries and other bloat from DeviantArt pages so you can focus on your task.
- **Indent guides**: A problem that has been around as long as nested comments is the difficulty you face in working out who replied to who in long and complex discussions. With DeviantTidy, just point at a comment to see guide-lines in the left margin, showing you the exact nest level the comment is on.
- **Cleaner forum threads**: Thread listings are now easier to browse, with all unnecessary icons removed, and shorter table rows (one line high instead of two, doubling the number of threads you can see per screen).
- **Floating comment box**: If you want to be able to type your comment on a deviation or journal while looking at the original, without having to constantly scroll up and down the page, this feature allows you to make the reply box float above the page content, following you wherever you scroll. Press ALT+SHIFT+C to activate it.
- **Hide thumbnails in deviation sidebar**: Reduce distractions by hiding 'more from this artist' and 'more like this' mini thumbnails when viewing art.
- Hide the orange **Upgrade to CORE** ad in the page header (turned off by default).
- **Keyboard browsing**: use the left/right arrow keys to browse galleries, favourites and the message center.
- **Shorten page titles**: remove filler text from page titles so you can read what's in a tab, even when you have too many tabs open.
- ...and many more!

## Installation

In order to use Greasemonkey scripts, you need to install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Mozilla Firefox, or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) for Google Chrome.

## FAQ

**How can I check that DeviantTidy is working?**
When you first install DeviantTidy (or the script component), a dialog will appear when you visit any DA page to let you know that it was successfully installed. You should also see a DeviantTidy link in the page footer.

**Can I use DeviantTidy with [insert your favourite skin or script here]?**
DeviantTidy can be used safely in combination with other custom deviant skins and scripts because it does the very minimum amount of changes required to get the desired effect.  In the rare event of clashes in styles or broken functionality, tell me about the issue, and include info about the other mods you are using.
